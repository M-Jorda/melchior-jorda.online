## Description
Welcome to **melchior-jorda.online**! This project serves as the source code for my personal website, designed to be **responsive** and **dynamic**. The primary goal of this site is to showcase my work and skills in web development. With a user-friendly interface and attractive design, visitors can explore my projects, learn more about my skills, and easily contact me.

## Technologies Used
This project utilizes several technologies to ensure an optimal user experience:
- **HTML/CSS**: Provide the structure and style of the website, ensuring a clear and pleasant layout.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity and dynamism to the site, enabling advanced features such as animations and real-time updates.
- **PHP**: Handles server-side operations, including form processing and data management.
- **JSON**: Used as a data exchange format, facilitating communication between the client and the server.

## Usage
This code is designed to present my work in a professional manner. To view the site, simply download the project files and open `index.html` in your browser. You will then have access to all the features and the interface I developed.

## Screenshots

## II/Pie Chart of My Skills
One of the key features of my site is the interactive pie chart, which highlights my technical skills. When a user clicks on the Java icon, the chart displays my skill levels and experiences in this area.
